# Raw DXIL writer checks

`dxil_writer_test.c` emits a compute shader directly from typed operations using
the owned DXIL/LLVM bitcode writer. It exercises integer and floating-point
arithmetic, dynamic control flow, phi nodes, casts, thread IDs and raw UAV
stores. It does not invoke a shader compiler or consume SPIR-V.
Vertex and pixel fixtures also check output-signature metadata and PSV tables.

On Linux, run:

```sh
make check-dxil-writer DXIL_VALIDATOR=/path/to/dxv
```

The check runs Microsoft's DXIL validator and requires its output to match the
native container byte for byte, including the checksum. The validator is a
development check, not a normal build dependency.

On Windows, compile `dxil_runtime_test.c` in a Visual Studio developer prompt:

```bat
cl /TC /W4 /WX /external:anglebrackets /external:W0 /D_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS tools\tests\dxil_runtime_test.c /link d3d12.lib dxgi.lib
dxil_runtime_test.exe build\make\host\dxil-writer-test.dxil
```

This creates a D3D12 WARP pipeline, dispatches the shader, copies its UAV to a
readback buffer and compares all 32 lane results against the expected values.
The authored test and support code use MSVC-compatible C89. The reused writer
implementation retains its original C code and license notices.

These checks validate the writer foundation. The guest shader translator and
the remaining D3D12 rendering paths still need to be connected to it before
the old conversion backend can be removed.
